                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Some preliminary research – at this point, it's mostly quotes &amp; graphs from various articles that are helping me to form foundational knowledge on the topic. Milestone 2 questions are towards the bottom of this page as well.<br><br><u><strong>info on Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS):</strong></u><br><br>BJS has not released data on jail deaths since 2013.<br><br>The&nbsp;<em>Mortality</em> report (formally called <em>Deaths in Custody</em>) are "our only 'official' source of information about deaths in prison and jail custody; they are essential for holding correctional agencies accountable for preventable deaths from suicide and homicide... The most recent data on jail deaths available is from 2013 — despite increasing attention to jail suicides and a law requiring this data to be reported annually — and three years of data have been collected since we last saw any reports" (Sawyer).<br><br>"The various government agencies involved in the justice system collect a lot of critical data, but it is not designed to help policymakers or the public understand what’s going on" (Sawyer &amp; Wagner).<br><br>"The Bureau of Justice Statistics is also many years behind schedule for at least one crucial and long-awaited data collection, the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (SILJ). The SILJ was collected every 5-7 years from 1972-2002, and it provides the most comprehensive, nationally representative data available on people held in local jails. It’s especially important for the information it offers about the pretrial (or unconvicted) population. Unbelievably, the 2002 SILJ is the most recent source we have to measure what portion of people held pretrial are there because they can’t afford a bail bond, what racial disparities exist among pretrial detainees, and what offenses people are locked up for before trial. After much delay, the current plan has the next survey slated for 2021; assuming it is released in 2022, it will be 15 years off-schedule" (Sawyer).<br><br>"Since late 2017, the Bureau of Justice Statistics has been under the leadership of Jeffrey Anderson, whose only prior statistical experience appears to be the co-creation of a college football computer ranking system in 1992. On criminal justice, all I could find in his history were a handful of 2015-2016 articles in which he argues against criminal justice reform" (Sawyer).<br><br><u><strong>background on local jails:</strong></u><br><br>"Local jails often receive short shrift in larger discussions about criminal justice, but they play a critical role as 'incarceration’s front door' and have a far greater impact than the daily population suggests...<br>Every year, over 600,000 people enter prison gates, but people go to jail 10.6 million times each year.  Jail churn is particularly high because most people in jails have not been convicted.  Some have just been arrested and will make bail within hours or days, while many others are too poor to make bail and remain behind bars until their trial. Only a small number (about 160,000 on any given day) have been convicted, and are generally serving misdemeanors sentences under a year. At least 1 in 4 people who go to jail will be arrested again within the same year — often those dealing with poverty, mental illness, and substance use disorders, whose problems only worsen with incarceration" (Sawyer &amp; Wagner).<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>info on suicides in local jails:</strong><br><br>Chammah &amp; Meagher:<br><br>"One reason why jails have a higher suicide rate (46 per 100,000 in 2013) than prisons (15 per 100,000) is that people who enter a jail often face a first-time “shock of confinement”; they are stripped of their job, housing, and basic sense of normalcy. Many commit suicide before they have been convicted at all. According to the BJS report, those rates are seven times higher than for convicted inmates" (Chammah &amp; Meagher).<br><br>"Although jails have improved their intake protocols over the past several decades, these protocols remain far less robust than in state prisons, which Michele Deitch, a professor at the University of Texas's LBJ School of Public Affairs, says, 'are shaped by years of litigation and the demands of the state legislature.'"(Chammah &amp; Meagher)...&nbsp;<br><br>"Often small facilities never get sued at all, even in the wake of a suicide caused by negligence. “Cases tend to focus on big facilities because that’s where we can help the most people,” says Amy Fettig, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project. “But to do all these little jails, which would take the same amount of resources, it’s just impossible, and so nothing gets done.” According to several prior BJS studies, the nation’s smallest jails have a suicide rate more than six times as high as the nation’s largest jails" (Chammah &amp; Meagher)...<br><br>"Many advocates point to a lack of statewide organizations that could force jails to improve their procedures before they get sued. California’s Division of Facilities Standards and Operations has nine inspectors for more than 600 facilities. The missions of these government bodies vary, but as Deitch wrote in a 50-state survey several years ago, “formal and comprehensive external oversight — in the form of inspections and routine monitoring of conditions that affect the rights of prisoners — is truly rare in this country'" (Chammah &amp; Meagher).<br><br>Sarat:<br><br>"American law recognizes a “special relationship” between the jailer and the prisoner, meaning that jailers have a legal responsibility to protect prisoners from harm — including self-harm.&nbsp;So suicide in jails and prisons is more than a personal tragedy. It often indicates a failure in the duty imposed on prison officials" (Sarat).<br><br>"Data from 2014 shows the magnitude of the suicide problem. In that year, 372 inmates killed themselves in local jails, resulting in a suicide rate of 50 deaths per 100,000 inmates."<br><br>"A study done by the nonprofit National Center on Institutions and Alternatives found that such suicides are “evenly distributed from the first few days of confinement to over several months of confinement, many suicides occurred during waking hours, most inmates were not under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol at the time of death, and many suicides occurred in close proximity to a court hearing."<br><br>"The large number of suicides in American jails occurs, in part, because they now house many people who, in the past, would have been sent to mental institutions."<br><br>"Suicide in jails also arises from the fact that those who are accused of a crime and cannot make bail are first sent there while awaiting trial. As Thomas White, an expert on suicide among incarcerated persons, observes, by the time people are serving their prison sentence, “the shock has worn off.”<br><br>"The rate at which people kill themselves in jails is, as The Associated Press reported in June 2019, “2 ½ times the rate of suicides in state prisons and about 3 ½ times that of the general population."<br><br>"In jails and prisons at both the state and federal level, the suicide rate was increasing when the Justice Department last reported its data from 2014" (Sarat).<br><br><br>"HuffPost’s jail deaths project, which sought to create a database of American jail deaths in the year after Bland’s demise, found that experts agree that suicides ― the most common cause of death inside jails since the turn of the century ― were nearly always preventable. The latest BJS report on 2014 jail deaths found the highest number of suicides in American jails since 2000" (Reilly).<br><br>"Even when released in a timely fashion, federal jail death statistics aren’t particularly useful. The statistics are aggregated to the state level, which makes it impossible to identify specific jails with particularly concerning death rates" (Reilly).&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>1. What questions can I explore with this dataset?</strong><br><br><u>what we are offered through this dataset include:</u><br>-locations and numbers of deaths by cause (suicides, homicides, drugs/alcohol, illness, accidents) for years 2008 – 2019; 38 jails were surveyed;<br>-IDs and counties of jails; avg daily inmate population by year; medical providers for each jail by year.<br>-date of death; first, middle, and last name; D.O.B.; race; gender; custody status (convicted or not)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><u>what can i explore?</u><br>-changes in the numbers of any of these categories over this time period – both statewide and for specific counties/locations<br>-one field i might want to focus in on is the convicted/unconvicted numbers; perhaps looking at this in relation to number of suicides (this relates to some of the research above).<br>-i can use maps to explore how the frequency of deaths (either by a category or as a total) varies throughout the state – and has changed over time.<br><strong>-in an effort to have this project be a humanistic endeavor, it might be interesting to see how I can work in the names of some of these folks into the project - as a way to remind myself and viewers that these are human beings that deserve to be remembered as more than a statistic or data point.&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>2. What questions do I want to explore, but are impossible with this dataset?</strong><br><br>-as the research above suggests, i am interested in relating this data to the shortcomings – and failures – of our government (the BJS) to collect, document, and make accessible this data.<br>-Reuters estimates that their data accounts for roughly 60% of the actual inmate jail deaths in this country. using that estimation, it might be powerful to juxtapose the Reuters data against what the projected actual numbers might look like if we had them. if i do this, i will have to decide what numbers i want to use (state totals? by county? by category? etc.)<br><br><strong>3. Is it possible to obtain the missing data I describe in question two? If so, how can I do it?</strong><br><strong><br></strong>-the missing data that I am interested in from the BJS does not exist; but as mentioned above, there might be creative ways around that.<br>-perhaps there are other bits of data not in this dataset that i haven't considered yet that i <em>can</em>&nbsp;access?<br>-i will say that i feel well supported by this dataset – it feels pretty robust, and i think it will give me more than enough to work with.<br><strong><br>4. What kinds of manipulation will this dataset require? Am I (will I be) capable of doing this myself, or will I need help?</strong><br><br>-so far, the first thing that i know i will need to do is merge the two tables (Reuters has separate CSVs for "death" and "jail" info that can be linked by jail ID number). i am currently working to see if i can do that myself.</p>
